Implementation of Hill Cipher, Luhn Algorithm, and RSA Algorithm

(I)*Hill Cipher* is a polyalphabetic cipher created by extending the Affine cipher, using linear algebra and modular arithmetic via a numeric matrix that serves as an encryption and decryption key.
> Encryption: E(K, P) = (K * P) mod 26  
> Decryption: D(K, C) = (K-1  * C) mod 26
